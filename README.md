# Askoverflow

AskOverflow is a simple ruby CLI app that allows a user to quickly search stackoverflow, view a simplified results list in the terminal, select a
result and view it's full question and accepted answer, then return to the results page to read a different result or submit a different search.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
